# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview
AlphabetSoup is a non-profit foundation dedicated to helping organizations that protect the environment, improve people’s well-being and unify the world. AlphabetSoup has raised and donated over $10 billion USD dollars in the past 20 years. This money has been used to invest in lifesaving technologies and organized reforestation groups, around the world.     

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the impact of each donation and vet potential recipients. This helps ensure the foundation’s money is being used effectively. Unfortunately, not every donation the company makes is impactful. In some cases, an organization will take the money and disappear. In trying to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk, a mathematical, data driven solution is created, which can do this accurately. 

Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

* **EIN** and **NAME**—Identification columns
* **APPLICATION_TYPE**—Alphabet Soup application type
* **AFFILIATION**—Affiliated sector of industry
* **CLASSIFICATION**—Government organization classification
* **USE_CASE**—Use case for funding
* **ORGANIZATION—Organization type
* **STATUS**—Active status
* **INCOME_AMT**—Income classification
* **SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS**—Special consideration for application
* **ASK_AMT**—Funding amount requested
* **IS_SUCCESSFUL**—Was the money used effectively
